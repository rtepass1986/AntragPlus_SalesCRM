> "How long have you been using that? And how's that been working for you?"

> "What made you look into changing/improving that?"

### Pain Point Questions:

> "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about [their current situation], what would it be?"

> "How is that affecting your [business/team/results]?"

> "What would it mean to you personally if we could solve that?"

### Impact Questions:

## 4. MINI-PRESENTATION (3-5 Minutes) 💡

**TIE YOUR SOLUTION DIRECTLY TO THEIR PAIN POINTS**

> "Got it. So based on what you're telling me, here's how we help companies like yours..."

> "[Explain solution focused on BENEFITS not features]"

> "Specifically for your situation with [their pain point], what that means is [benefit tied to their pain]."

> "The reason this works so well is [proof/case study/social proof]."

### Build the Three Tens:

**Product Certainty**:
> "Companies like [similar company] were dealing with the same [pain point], and after implementing our solution, they saw [specific result] in [timeframe]."

**Salesperson Certainty**:
> "I've been helping companies in [their industry] solve this exact problem for [time period]. I've seen this work firsthand."

**Company Certainty**:
> "We've been doing this since [year], with over [number] clients, including [impressive client names]."

**Key Points**:
- Focus on benefits, not features
- Tie everything to their specific pain
- Use social proof and case studies
- Build certainty in all three areas

## 5. TRIAL CLOSE (Test Certainty Levels) ✓

> "Based on what I've shared so far, on a scale of 1 to 10, how certain are you that [product] can solve [their pain point]?"

*[Listen to their response]*

**If 8-10**: Move to close  
**If 5-7**: Handle objections, provide more certainty  
**If 1-4**: Might not be a fit, qualify further

> "What would it take to get you to a 10?"

*[Address their concerns]*

---

## 6. HANDLING OBJECTIONS 🛡️

### Common Objections & Responses:

**"I need to think about it"**
> "I totally understand, [Name]. Let me ask you - what specifically do you need to think about? Is it the product itself, the timing, or the investment?"

*[Isolate the real objection, then address it]*

**"It's too expensive"**
> "I hear you, [Name]. And honestly, if you felt the same way after we solve [their pain], I'd agree with you. But here's the thing - what's it costing you RIGHT NOW to not have this solved? [Quantify their pain cost]"

**"I need to talk to my [partner/boss/team]"**
> "Absolutely, [Name]. And I respect that. Let me ask - if they said yes, would YOU be ready to move forward? [Isolate their certainty] What concerns do you think they might have?"

**Key Principle**: Loop back to certainty. Every objection means certainty in one of the Three Tens is not at 10.

## 7. CLOSE (Ask for the Sale) 🎯

**ALWAYS ASK FOR THE SALE - MULTIPLE TIMES IF NEEDED**

### Alternative Choice Close:
> "So [Name], we have two options: [Option A] or [Option B]. Which makes more sense for you?"

### Assumptive Close:
> "Perfect. So what I'll do is get you set up today, and you'll be able to [benefit] by [timeframe]. Sound good?"

### Direct Close:
> "So [Name], are you ready to get started?"

### Next Step Close:
> "Great! So the next step is [next step - demo, trial, contract]. I have [time slot 1] or [time slot 2] available. Which works better for you?"

**Key Points**:
- Always ask for the sale
- If they say no, loop back and rebuild certainty
- Close multiple times if needed
- Be persistent but professional

## 8. POST-CLOSE REINFORCEMENT ✅

**AFTER THEY SAY YES**

> "[Outline next steps clearly]"

> "One thing I want you to know - I'm going to be with you every step of the way to make sure you get [the result they want]. Sound good?"

**Reduce buyer's remorse**: Reinforce their decision, outline clear next steps, build excitement
